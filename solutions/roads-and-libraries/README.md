### [Roads and Libraries](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/torque-and-development/problem)
- Determine the minimum cost to provide library access to all citizens of HackerLand. There are n cities numbered from 1 to n. Currently there are no libraries and the cities are not connected. Bidirectional roads may be built between any city pair listed in cities. A citizen has access to a library if:
    - Their city contains a library.
    - They can travel by road from their city to a city containing a library.

- Function Params Description
    - int n: integer, the number of cities
    - int c_lib: integer, the cost to build a library
    - int c_road: integer, the cost to repair a road
    - int cities[m][2]: each cities[i] contains two integers that represent cities that can be connected by a new road
