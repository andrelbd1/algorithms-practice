### Dijkstra
- Dijkstra’s algorithm is a popular search algorithm used to determine the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. In the original scenario, the graph represented the Netherlands, the graph’s nodes represented different Dutch cities, and the edges represented the roads between the cities. You can apply Dijkstra’s algorithm to any problem that can be represented as a graph.
