### Factorial
- The factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. It is denoted as `n!`.

#### Mathematical Definition
- `n! = n × (n - 1) × (n - 2) × ... × 1`
- Special case: `0! = 1` (by definition)

Examples:
- `5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120`
- `3! = 3 × 2 × 1 = 6`
- `0! = 1`
