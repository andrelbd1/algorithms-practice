### Batched
- The batched function is a generator that yields batches of the specified size from the input iterable.
- The last batch may be smaller than the specified size if the input iterable is not evenly divisible by the batch size.
- The function is useful for processing large datasets in smaller chunks, which can help with memory management and performance.
