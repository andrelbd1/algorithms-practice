### Dunder Methods
- Dunder methods, short for "double underscore methods" and also known as magic methods, are special methods in Python that allow you to define custom behavior for built-in operations. These methods are surrounded by double underscores (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`, `__add__`) and enable you to customize object creation, representation, comparison, arithmetic operations, and more. They provide a way to make your classes integrate seamlessly with Python's syntax and built-in features.

#### Examples
##### `__eq__`
- [Equality check for all attributes](__eq__1.py)
- [Equality check for a single attribute](__eq__2.py)

##### `__lt__`
- [Comparison for less-than operation](__lt__1.py)

##### `__add__`
- [Adding objects with the `+` operator](__add__1.py)

##### `__format__`
- [Custom string formatting](__format__1.py)
- [Custom string formatting](__format__2.py)

##### `__repr__`
- [Custom string representation for debugging and logging](__repr__1.py)

##### `__or__`
- [Combining objects with the `|` operator](__or__1.py)

##### `__getitem__`
- [Accessing items using square brackets](__getitem__1.py)
